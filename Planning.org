* Steps to improve ML
** Make it easier to debug model
*** Custom saving code, custom graphing code
*** Save gradients and track how they change over time
*** Show weights, check for NaN
*** New script maybe to track gradients
** Change GAN structure
*** Simple ANN Layer instead of LSTM
*** Maybe try CNN as discriminator
** Improvements from other papers
*** Original GAN Paper
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf
*** TextRNN
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03850.pdf
*** Pre-trained model into GAN
*** Link for GAN resources
