371 four-part chorales by Johann Sebastian Bach
===============================================

Four-part chorales collected after J.S. Bach's death by his son C.P.E. Bach (and finished by Kirnberger, J.S. Bach's student, after C.P.E. Bach's death). Ordered by Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel numbers.

The first complete edition of these chorales was published by Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel between 1784&ndash;1787 in four volumes. The first incomplete edition consisting of 200 chorales in two volumes was published by Friedrich Wilhelm Birnstiel in 1765 & 1769, reprinted in 1975 by Georg Olms.

This digital edition is referenced against the fourth edition of the chorales by Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel, c. 1875: 371 vierstimmige Choralges&auml;nge von Johann Sebastian Bach. 4th ed. by Alfred D&ouml;rffel.
